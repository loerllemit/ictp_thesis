\section{Objectives}

Describe importance of analyzing interfaces. Surface tension of different
solutes.

\begin{itemize}
    \item To develop accurate and transferrable DeepNN potentials for
          interfaces
    \item To explore the quality of the training data set in improving the
          description of water interfaces.
    \item To understand reliability of the current architecture of DeepMD in
          dealing with interfaces.
