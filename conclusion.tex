\chapter{Conclusion and Future Work}

In this thesis, we generated a deep neural network potential and assess its
predictability in obtaining relevant system properties such as density, surface
tension, and dipole orientation. Neural network potential trained on only bulk
systems did not perform well when used on trajectories containing interfaces.
Specifically, it predicted very underestimated values of surface tension and
slightly underestimated bulk density. Adding surface dataset to the training
did improve the prediction of surface tension, implying that surface defects
play a role in surface properties of water.

This thesis was only conducted at smaller system size of 192 water molecules,
and finite size effects might masked the actual results. Hence, it is
recommended to do MD simulations at larger system size as to decouple
fluctuations that happens in the bulk and interface regions.

It is interesting to see what happens to relevant system's properties such as
surface tension when long range interactions are taken into account during
the training of neural network potentials.
