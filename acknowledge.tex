I thanked him for rendering his valuable time in giving constructive criticism and to instill in my mind to always ask questions and examine all possible solutions to unanswered problems. I thanked Cesare Malosso, my co-supervisor, for guiding me in preparing codes, for orienting me on how the code works, and for his feedbacks. I also thanked Edward Donkor, my co-supervisor, for giving me some of his codes and for his  feedbacks. I thanked the atomistic simulations group for grilling my presentation for which I improved a lot.

I thanked all the professors for rendering their time and sharing their expertise to future prospective full-fledged scientists. I  thanked the library staffs for all the assistance. I thanked my fellow classmates for the fruitful discussions.
